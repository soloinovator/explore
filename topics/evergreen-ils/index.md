Evergreen is an open source integrated library system (ILS) designed for public, academic, and consortial libraries. It powers large statewide catalogs and thousands of libraries by providing circulation, cataloging, acquisitions, serials, reporting, and a patron-facing catalog. Evergreen is built on PostgreSQL and the OpenSRF service framework, with web-based staff and public interfaces. The project is community-governed, released under GPL-2.0-or-later, and welcomes contributions across code, documentation, translation, and operations. Learn more on the project site, explore the documentation and wiki, and connect via the community links.
